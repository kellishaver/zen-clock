Zen Clock
====

A very relaxing time-keeping experience.

Zen Clock sets the page background color by altering RGB values starting at 0 and increasing in increments of N * 10.6 rounded up for hours and N * 4.25 rounded up for minutes/seconds (255 / 24 = 10.6 and 255 / 60 = 4.25). The end result is pretty decent coverage of the RGB value ranges over the course of a day.

* Hours trigger red shift.
* Minutes trigger green shift.
* Seconds trigger blue shift.

Audio was added to complete the experience.
